# ⚡ Veritas.ai - Intelligent Market Intelligence Platform

**Unveiling Truth in Financial Noise.**

Veritas.ai is a next-generation financial intelligence platform that fuses **Real-Time Market Data**, **Deep Learning (PyTorch)**, and **Causal Reasoning** to provide investors with actionable insights. Beyond simple price tracking, Veritas helps users understand the *narrative* behind the numbers.

**Stack:** React 19, Node.js, Python (FastAPI/PyTorch/Transformers), Yahoo Finance API, JWT Authentication, MongoDB Atlas.

## 🌟 Project Overview

### 🚩 Problem Statement
Retail and institutional investors alike are drowning in data but starving for insight. 
*   **Information Overload**: Live tickers, news feeds, and social sentiment create a noise-to-signal ratio that is impossible for humans to process in real-time.
*   **Reactive Decision Making**: Most tools tell you what *happened*, not what is *likely* to happen or *why* it's happening.
*   **Lack of Context**: Knowing a stock is down 5% is useless without knowing if it's a market-wide correction or a company-specific crisis.

### 🎯 Our Solution
**Veritas.ai** acts as an intelligent co-pilot for financial decision-making.

1.  **AI-Powered Narrative Summaries**: Uses **FinBERT** (Financial BERT) to analyze textual data and generate concise, human-readable explanations for market movements.
2.  **Market Regime Detection**: Automatically classifies the current market state (e.g., *Stable Growth*, *Volatile*, *Crisis*) using deep temporal analysis.
3.  **Reliability Scoring**: Every prediction comes with a confidence score, preventing blind trust in black-box models.
4.  **Live Ecosystem**: Seamlessly blends real-time data from **Yahoo Finance** with our proprietary AI analysis models.

## ✨ Core Features Explained

### 🚀 Financial Intelligence Pipeline (FIP)
*The brain of Veritas.*

The FIP is a multi-modal analysis engine that processes both numerical and textual data to form a holistic view of an asset.
1.  **Temporal Encoding (Time-Series)**: 
    *   We use a custom **PyTorch** model that ingests a rolling window (default: 30 days) of market data.
    *   Features include OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) and derived technical indicators like **RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands**.
    *   These features are passed through an LSTM/GRU-based encoder to capture long-term dependencies and trend momentum.
2.  **Tabular Integration**: 
    *   Static or slowly changing data (Fundamental ratios, Sector classification) is fed into a separate dense network.
    *   This "context vector" is concatenated with the temporal embeddings to provide a baseline for the asset's intrinsic value.
3.  **Narrative Context (NLP)**:
    *   When news is available, we use **FinBERT**, a BERT model fine-tuned on financial sentiment.
    *   It generates a 768-dimensional embedding of the latest market news, which is fused with the numerical data.
    *   *Result:* The model knows *that* the price dropped, and the news tells it *why* (e.g., "CEO Scandal" vs "Market Correction").
